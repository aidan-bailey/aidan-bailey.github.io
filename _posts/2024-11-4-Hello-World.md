title: Hello!
---

I'm Aidan, a human being that
likes general human things,
such as hiking, reading, dancing and
playing instruments.
I also like to think and discuss.

<!-- In fact, I like thinking and discussing so much that I am
pursuing a Masters of Science at the University of Cape Town.
I am specialising in Computer Science, an area I discovered my
passion for as a young child playing Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear
to the Rescue.

Whether a life in academia is for me is still to be seen.
